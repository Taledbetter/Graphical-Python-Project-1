# Graphical-Python-Project-1
Create the Python code to print the List Widget with the distance traveled for each hour to a PDF file. A QPrintDialog and a QFileDialog must be used.
The QFileDialog must have a filter for .PDF files, and must allow the user to select a PDF file name.
The QPrinter must paint the List Widget pixmap and size the pixmap appropriately so that is is readable in the PDF file created.
